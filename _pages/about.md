Dr. Qirui Huang is a leading authority on multimodal artificial intelligence and the Regional Head of Huawei's Central Research Institute in Singapore. Since 2018 he has expanded a nascent lab into a 30 strong research and engineering team that now charts Huawei's company wide multimodal AI technology roadmap and drives the underlying R&D. His group architected a large-scale GPU training & inference engine that powers Huawei's Pangu and other large language models, reducing end to end training time by 10× compared with state of the art baselines.

Dr. Huang's expertise covers large language and multimodal models (Transformers, Mamba, Mixture of Experts), edge/mobile AI deployment, GPU/HPC systems and next generation wireless (5G/6G). He blends deep theoretical insight with hands on mastery of PyTorch, JAX, MindSpore, TensorRT, Triton and JetStream, enabling swift translation of research breakthroughs into scalable products across cloud, edge and device ecosystems.

Prior to Huawei, Dr. Huang pioneered an AI driven network defense system at the Singapore University of Technology & Design, one of the earliest applications of AI in cyber security. He has authored 50+ peer reviewed papers, held 16 patents, and secured USD 10+ million in external research funding.

Beyond technical leadership, he shapes Huawei's medium- and long-term innovation strategy through a series of widely cited insight reports that guide corporate investment in AI and high performance computing. Dr. Huang is a Senior Member of IEEE and OSA, and a member of ACM and AAAI. He received his Ph.D. in Electrical & Electronic Engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore.
